    `As time passes, I encounter more moments that challenge me and push me to grow. Falling and stumbling have been necessary parts of my journey toward personal development. This path has involved making sacrifices and facing obstacles that pushed me out of my comfort zone. I've learned that situations where I’m faced with the choice to sink or swim offer the strongest lessons, teaching me how to adapt and persevere. In the past, I tended to live comfortably, avoiding uncomfortable possibilities by convincing myself everything was fine. However, I’ve come to realize that this mindset was only setting me up for failure. Now, I’m focused on embracing discomfort and actively seeking growth opportunities, understanding that true progress comes from stepping beyond my comfort zone. \n
    Another point that keeps me going in life is the unparalleled support from my close friends and family. I will never forget a time when I took a big risk and was extremely anxious about letting my parents down. Instead of expressing disappointment, my mother gave me a hug and said to me 'I will always support you with whatever you choose to do.' Moments like this remind me to just keep going and never give up on any opportunity that comes my way.`,
